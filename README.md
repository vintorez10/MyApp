Hello everyone!)) This is a simple console application that reads text from a " txt "file to the "std:: map" associative array;
Sorts and discards punctuation marks and numbers, and then writes the most common key/value pairs to the file; 
the application is intended for my training in working with associative containers, as well as for input and output of files;
